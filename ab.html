                <p> One of the disadvantages of this system is that you cannot increase the number of pixels to increase the resolution of the image more than its normal size with this program,</p>
                <p> and the degree of accuracy is measured Images and their clarity by the number of.</p>

                <p> John Noll, who was working at the Andrometric Light and Magic company that produces scanners. John Noll, with the help of his brother Thomas, created this program for</p>
                <p> editing images within six months, and after that they renamed the program  Image Pro, then they called it Photoshop, then they agreed with Barney Scan to distribute this</p>
                <p> program with the company's scanners. During this period, John made a presentation to engineers at Apple, especially to Russell Brown (the company's technical director),This</p>
                  <p> work was crowned with success after Adobe purchased a license to distribute the program in September 1988. At this time, John worked on the additional components of the</p>
                  <p> program and Thomas worked on writing the program codes, and finally; The first version of the program was launched. In 1990 on Macintosh computers, we have</p>
                  <p> finished writing a detailed overview of Photoshop.</p>
